    <h1>ü•ê Croissant - Croissant World</h1>
    <p>It is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of the Austrian kipferl, 
        but using the French yeast-leavened laminated dough. <br> Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape. 
        The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, <br> then rolled into a thin sheet, 
        in a technique called laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.</p>
